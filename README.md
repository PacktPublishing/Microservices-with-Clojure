# Microservices with Clojure
This is the code repository for [Microservices with Clojure](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/microservices-clojure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788622240), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern from which to build web-based applications and aids in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain web applications. This book will teach you common patterns and practices, showing you how to apply these using the Clojure programming language.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The chapters 1 to 5 and 7 does not have any code files.

The book has been conceptually divided into four modules as following:

Part 1- Getting Started

Chapter 1: Monolithic Versus Microservices
Chapter 2: Microservices Architecture
Chapter 3: Microservices for Helping Hands Application

Part 2- Preparing for Microservices

Chapter 4: Development Environment
Chapter 5: REST APIs for Microservices
Chapter 6: Introduction to Pedestal
Chapter 7: Achieving Immutability with Datomic

Part 3- Building Microservices

Chapter 8: Building Microservices for Helping Hands
Chapter 9: Configuring Microservices
Chapter 10: Event-Driven Patterns for Microservices

Part 4- Microservices in Production

Chapter 11: Deploying and Monitoring Secured Microservices

The code will look like the following:
```
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "status": "O"
    }
  }
}
```

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to run and develop applications using Clojure. You can get the JDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. It is also recommended that you use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice for implementation. Some of the examples in the chapters require Linux as an operating system.
